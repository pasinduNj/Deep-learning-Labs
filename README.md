Neural Network for Diabetes Prediction (Keras)
This repository contains a lab implementation of a binary classification neural network using the Keras library. The goal is to predict the onset of diabetes based on medical diagnostic measurements from the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
Project Overview
The objective of this lab is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of building a simple neural ne
Data preprocessing and standardization.

Architecting a model using the Keras Sequential API.

Training and evaluating model performance
Dataset Description
The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset includes several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome).

Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age.

Target: Binary outcome (1 for diabetes, 0 for no diabetes).
